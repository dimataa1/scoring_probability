#  NBA Players Shot Heatmaps

This project visualizes **simulated shot frequency heatmaps** for NBA players such as Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant. Using mathematical models and `Matplotlib`, it maps player shooting tendencies onto a FIBA-style basketball court.

The goal is to provide an intuitive representation of where players are most active or efficient on the court, using simulated data based on known player behavior patterns.
